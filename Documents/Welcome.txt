Welcome to Encore.

Encore is a scalable server architecture aiming at emulating the World of Warcraft
game servers. It uses an actor-based threading model, and an abstract SQL layer for
databasing (supporting most SQL servers).

The source base is written in pure C# code, using the Common Language Runtime and
the .NET Framework. We focus on supporting both the Microsoft and Mono runtimes.
